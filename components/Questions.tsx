              Even small local businesses that only serve their hometown need a
              site. Thats because the web is the first place people go when
              looking for a product or service. A website helps every business:
              <ul>
                <li>Promote and sell their products and services</li>
                <li>
                  Connect with new customers (and keep existing customers)
                </li>
                <li>Build credibility</li>
                <li>
                  Compete with bigger businesses Control their brand and keep
                  their marketing fresh and current
                </li>
              </ul>
              Best of all, a website is much easier and more affordable than you
              might think. GoDaddy offers a complete selection of online tools
              for building websites, along with hosting, email and marketing
              options to grow their business on the web.

              domain-based email, but here are the top 3:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Customers are much more likely to trust a professional address
                  like lily@lilysbikes.com than lilysbikestexas84@notmail.com.

                  Personalized email addresses promote your business more
                  effectively. Every time you send an email, you are giving your
                  web address to customers and prospects, encouraging them to
                  visit your website.
